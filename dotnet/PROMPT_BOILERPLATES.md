## 8. Few-Shot Prompting

### Classification with Examples

```csharp
var sentimentAgent = chatClient
    .CreateAIAgent(name: "SentimentAnalyzer")
    .WithInstructions(@"
You are a sentiment analysis expert.

Analyze the sentiment of customer feedback and classify as: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

EXAMPLES:

Input: ""The product is amazing! Exceeded my expectations.""
Output: POSITIVE
Reasoning: Enthusiastic language, praise

Input: ""Shipping was slow but product is okay.""
Output: NEUTRAL
Reasoning: Mixed sentiment, both criticism and acceptance

Input: ""Terrible quality. Requesting refund immediately.""
Output: NEGATIVE
Reasoning: Strong negative language, dissatisfaction

Input: ""It works as described.""
Output: NEUTRAL
Reasoning: Factual statement without emotional language

Now analyze the following feedback. Provide:
1. Classification (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE/NEUTRAL)
2. Brief reasoning
3. Confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
    ")
    .Build();

var response = await sentimentAgent.RunAsync(
    "The customer service was responsive but the product broke after a week."
);
```

### Code Generation with Examples

```csharp
var codeGenAgent = chatClient
    .CreateAIAgent(name: "CodeGenerator")
    .WithInstructions(@"
You are a C# code generator following best practices.

Generate clean, well-documented C# code based on descriptions.

EXAMPLES:

Request: ""Create a class to represent a book with title, author, and ISBN""

Response:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Represents a book with essential bibliographic information.
/// </summary>
public class Book
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the book's title.
    /// </summary>
    public string Title { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the book's author.
    /// </summary>
    public string Author { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the book's ISBN number.
    /// </summary>
    public string ISBN { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the Book class.
    /// </summary>
    public Book(string title, string author, string isbn)
    {
        Title = title ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(title));
        Author = author ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(author));
        ISBN = isbn ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(isbn));
    }
}
```

---

Request: ""Method to calculate the sum of an array""

Response:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Calculates the sum of all integers in the array.
/// </summary>
/// <param name=""numbers"">The array of integers to sum.</param>
/// <returns>The sum of all elements in the array.</returns>
/// <exception cref=""ArgumentNullException"">Thrown when numbers is null.</exception>
public static int CalculateSum(int[] numbers)
{
    if (numbers == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(numbers));

    return numbers.Sum();
}
```

GUIDELINES:
- Include XML documentation
- Use appropriate access modifiers
- Follow C# naming conventions
- Add null checks where appropriate
- Keep methods focused (single responsibility)

Now generate code for the following request:
    ")
    .Build();
```

## 9. Structured Output Prompts

### JSON Response Agent

```csharp
var structuredAgent = chatClient
    .CreateAIAgent(name: "StructuredData")
    .WithInstructions(@"
You extract information and return it in strict JSON format.

OUTPUT FORMAT (always use this exact structure):
{
    ""entity_name"": ""<name>"",
    ""entity_type"": ""<person|organization|location|other>"",
    ""attributes"": {
        ""<key1>"": ""<value1>"",
        ""<key2>"": ""<value2>""
    },
    ""confidence"": <0.0-1.0>
}

RULES:
1. Always respond with valid JSON
2. Do not include any text before or after the JSON
3. Use null for missing information
4. Confidence should reflect certainty

EXAMPLE:

Input: ""Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates in 1975 in Albuquerque.""

Output:
{
    ""entity_name"": ""Microsoft"",
    ""entity_type"": ""organization"",
    ""attributes"": {
        ""founder"": ""Bill Gates"",
        ""founded_year"": ""1975"",
        ""founded_location"": ""Albuquerque""
    },
    ""confidence"": 0.95
}
    ")
    .Build();

var response = await structuredAgent.RunAsync(
    "Extract information: Tesla is headquartered in Austin, Texas."
);
```

### Form Validation Agent

```csharp
public class FormValidationAgent
{
    private readonly AIAgent _agent;

    public record ValidationResult(
        bool IsValid,
        Dictionary<string, string> Errors,
        Dictionary<string, string> Suggestions
    );

    public FormValidationAgent(IChatClient chatClient)
    {
        _agent = chatClient
            .CreateAIAgent(name: "FormValidator")
            .WithInstructions(@"
You validate form data and provide feedback.

INPUT: JSON object with form fields
OUTPUT: JSON validation result

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    ""is_valid"": <true|false>,
    ""errors"": {
        ""<field_name>"": ""<error_message>""
    },
    ""suggestions"": {
        ""<field_name>"": ""<improvement_suggestion>""
    }
}

VALIDATION RULES:
- email: Valid email format
- phone: Valid phone number (US format)
- password: At least 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special char
- username: 3-20 chars, alphanumeric only
- age: Number between 13 and 120
- url: Valid URL format

EXAMPLE:

Input:
{
    ""email"": ""invalid-email"",
    ""password"": ""weak"",
    ""age"": ""25""
}

Output:
{
    ""is_valid"": false,
    ""errors"": {
        ""email"": ""Invalid email format"",
        ""password"": ""Password must be at least 8 characters with uppercase, number, and special character""
    },
    ""suggestions"": {
        ""password"": ""Try: Str0ng!Pass""
    }
}

Validate the form data now.
            ")
            .Build();
    }

    public async Task<ValidationResult> ValidateAsync(object formData)
    {
        var json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(formData);
        var response = await _agent.RunAsync($"Validate this form data:\n{json}");
        
        var result = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ValidationResult>(
            response.Messages.Last().Text
        );
        
        return result ?? new ValidationResult(false, new(), new());
    }
}
```

## Best Practices for Prompts

### DO:
✅ Be specific and clear about the agent's role  
✅ Provide examples of expected behavior  
✅ Define the output format explicitly  
✅ Include relevant context and constraints  
✅ Specify tone and style guidelines  
✅ Use structured sections (GUIDELINES, RULES, etc.)  
✅ Test prompts with edge cases  
✅ Iterate based on results  

### DON'T:
❌ Make prompts overly long (focus on essentials)  
❌ Use ambiguous language  
❌ Assume the model knows your specific domain  
❌ Forget to specify what NOT to do  
❌ Mix multiple unrelated instructions  
❌ Use pronouns without clear antecedents  
❌ Forget to handle error cases

## Prompt Engineering Tips

1. **Start Simple, Add Complexity**: Begin with basic instructions and add details as needed
2. **Use Delimiters**: Separate different sections clearly (---, ===, etc.)
3. **Specify Output Format First**: Tell the model what you want before asking questions
4. **Include Examples**: Few-shot learning significantly improves results
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Try unusual inputs to find prompt weaknesses
6. **Version Control**: Keep track of prompt changes and their effects
7. **Use System vs User Messages**: Leverage message roles appropriately
8. **Be Explicit About Context**: Don't assume the model remembers everything
